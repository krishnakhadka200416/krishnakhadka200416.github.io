## About Me

Hello! I am a PhD candidate in Machine Learning at The University of Texas at Arlington with 6 first-authored publications (46+ citations) in top-tier venues including KDD and ASE. My research focuses on explainable AI, adversarial robustness, and trustworthy ML systems, conducted in collaboration with NIST. I am also the co-founder of Bhasha Tech, an AI-powered language learning platform serving 50,000+ users across 130+ countries. I combine deep research expertise with proven ability to build and scale real-world ML products.
